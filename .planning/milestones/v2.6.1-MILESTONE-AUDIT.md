# v2.6.1 Milestone Audit Report (Re-audit)

**Previous Audit:** 2026-02-20T15:00:00Z (gaps_found → led to Phases 204-205)
**This Audit:** 2026-02-20T21:00:00Z (re-audit after gap closure phases)

## Overview

| Dimension | Score | Details |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Requirements | 12/27 formally verified, 27/27 SUMMARY-claimed | 15 requirements implemented but missing formal VERIFICATION.md |
| Phases | 2/4 verified | Phase 202, 203 missing VERIFICATION.md artifacts |
| Integration | 27/27 wired | Integration checker confirmed all cross-phase connections |
| E2E Flows | 4/4 code-verified | 2 flows need human testing (live ntfy/Telegram) |

## Status: gaps_found

**Root Cause:** Phase 202 and Phase 203 were never run through the formal verifier (gsd-verifier). They have no VERIFICATION.md files. Per audit workflow step 5e, 15 requirements present in the traceability table but absent from ALL VERIFICATION.md files are classified as "orphaned" and treated as "unsatisfied".

**Important Context:** This is a **procedural gap**, not a substantive one:
- All 27 requirements are marked `[x] Complete` in REQUIREMENTS.md
- All 27 requirements appear in SUMMARY `requirements-completed` frontmatter
- Integration checker confirmed all 27 requirements are fully wired end-to-end
- All prior GAPs (GAP-1, GAP-2, GAP-3) from the first audit are closed by Phases 204-205

## 3-Source Cross-Reference

### Formally Verified (12/27) — Present in VERIFICATION.md

| WALLET-07 | Phase 205: SATISFIED | 203-04, 205-02, 205-03 | [x] | **satisfied** |
| CONF-01 | Phase 205: SATISFIED | 202-01, 205-01, 205-03 | [x] | **satisfied** |

### Orphaned from Verification (15/27) — Not in any VERIFICATION.md

| REQ | Phase | SUMMARY FM | REQS.md | Integration | Final Status |
|-----|-------|------------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| PROTO-02 | 202 | 202-01 | [x] | WIRED | **orphaned** (no Phase 202 VERIFICATION) |
| PROTO-04 | 202 | 202-02 | [x] | WIRED | **orphaned** |

| WALLET-06 | 203 | 203-04 | [x] | WIRED | **orphaned** |
| CONF-02 | 202 | 202-01 | [x] | WIRED | **orphaned** |

**Orphan Source:** Phase 202 (12 reqs) and Phase 203 (3 reqs) — both phases lack VERIFICATION.md files.

## Phase Verification Status

| Phase | Plans | Summaries | VERIFICATION.md | Status |
|-------|-------|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| 202 | 4/4 | 4/4 | **MISSING** | Unverified |
| 203 | 4/4 | 4/4 | **MISSING** | Unverified |
| 204 | 2/2 | 2/2 | human_needed (5/5 automated) | Verified |
| 205 | 3/3 | 3/3 | passed (9/9) | Verified |

## Integration Checker Results

**Cross-phase wiring:** 27/27 requirements fully wired
**Orphaned exports:** 0
**Missing connections:** 0 (all 3 prior GAPs closed)
**Broken flows:** 0 in code
**Unprotected routes:** 0

### E2E Flows Verified

| Flow | Code Path | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| SDK ntfy signing | stage4Wait → ApprovalChannelRouter → NtfySigningChannel → ntfy → SSE → SignResponseHandler | WIRED (human test needed) |
| SDK Telegram signing | stage4Wait → ApprovalChannelRouter → TelegramSigningChannel → Telegram → /sign_response → SignResponseHandler | WIRED (human test needed) |
| Admin approval method | Admin UI radio → PUT /wallets/:id/owner → DB → ApprovalChannelRouter reads per-wallet | WIRED |
| Admin settings management | Admin Settings → PUT /admin/settings → SettingsService → signing_sdk.enabled controls lifecycle | WIRED |

## Prior GAPs — All Closed

| GAP | Description | Closed By | Verified In |
|-----|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| GAP-1 | Signing SDK not wired into daemon lifecycle | Phase 204-01 (commit 33b1987) | 204-VERIFICATION.md SC1-SC3 |
| GAP-2 | signResponseHandler not injected into TelegramBotService | Phase 204-02 (commit 69c4976) | 204-VERIFICATION.md T5 |
| GAP-3 | GET /admin/settings omits signing_sdk category | Phase 205-01 (commit 6667f56) | 205-VERIFICATION.md Truth 1-4 |

## Tech Debt

| Phase | Item | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 204 | signing_sdk.enabled requires daemon restart (by design, consistent with lifecycle settings) | INFO |
| 204 | Pre-existing daemon.ts:1024-1025 stub (Phase 50-04) | INFO |
| 205 | signing_sdk.wallets excluded from Admin Settings UI (managed by WalletLinkRegistry) | LOW |

## Human Verification Required

### 1. SDK ntfy Signing Flow E2E
- Configure `signing_sdk.enabled=true`, wallet `owner_approval_method=sdk_ntfy`
- Submit transfer transaction, observe ntfy publish, approve via wallet app
- Expected: PENDING_APPROVAL → APPROVED

### 2. SDK Telegram Signing Flow E2E
- Configure `signing_sdk.enabled=true` with Telegram bot token, wallet `owner_approval_method=sdk_telegram`
- Submit transfer, observe Telegram inline button, use `/sign_response` command
- Expected: PENDING_APPROVAL → APPROVED

## Recommended Fix

**Run gsd-verifier for Phase 202 and Phase 203** to generate their VERIFICATION.md files. This will resolve all 15 orphaned requirements without any code changes, since all requirements are substantively implemented and wired.
