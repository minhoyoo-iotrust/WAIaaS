# Milestone v2.3 Audit Report

**Milestone:** v2.3 Admin UI 기능별 메뉴 재구성
**Audited:** 2026-02-18T11:00:00Z
**Status:** tech_debt (no critical blockers)

## Executive Summary

All 39 requirements are functionally satisfied. All 5 phases completed with 10 plans. Cross-phase integration verified by automated checker. Two minor integration issues (display.currency highlight, duplicate search index ID) are non-blocking. Phase 182 is missing a formal VERIFICATION.md file but its 7 requirements are confirmed working by downstream phase verifications and integration wiring checks.

### E2E Flows

| Flow | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Settings Search → Navigate → Highlight | COMPLETE (53/54 fields) | display.currency CurrencySelect highlight fails silently |
| Settings Edit → Save | COMPLETE | All 8 tabs independently save via filtered apiPut |
| Dirty Guard Tab Switch | COMPLETE | 3-button dialog on all TabNav dirty transitions |
| Dirty Guard Sidebar Nav | COMPLETE | 3-button dialog on sidebar nav with dirty state |
| New Settings Exposure | COMPLETE | session_absolute_lifetime, session_max_renewals, relay_url, cross_validation_threshold all accessible |

### Integration Findings

#### FINDING-01: display.currency highlight (Low severity)

CurrencySelect component in system.tsx renders a `<select>` without a `name="display.currency"` attribute. The search index entry for "Display Currency" sets `highlightField.value = 'display.currency'` on click, but `FormField` in form.tsx looks for `[name="display.currency"]` which doesn't exist. The field highlight animation silently fails for this one field. All other 53 fields highlight correctly.

**Affected:** SRCH-03 (partial -- 53/54 fields work)

#### FINDING-02: Duplicate search index ID (Low severity)

`settings-search-index.ts` lines 78 and 87 both have `id: 'notifications.settings.telegram_bot_token'`. When both entries appear in a search result (searching "telegram bot"), Preact receives duplicate `key` props causing potential rendering inconsistency. Functional impact is low because both entries navigate to the correct page/tab.

**Affected:** SRCH-02 (rendering risk)

## Tech Debt Summary

| Category | Phase | Item | Severity |
|----------|-------|------|----------|
| Procedural | 182 | Missing VERIFICATION.md (7 requirements lack formal phase verification) | Low |
| Integration | 185 | display.currency highlight silent failure | Low |
| Integration | 185 | Duplicate search index ID | Low |
| Pre-existing | - | wallets.tsx Badge style prop TS error | Info |
| Pre-existing | - | policies.tsx template literal URL TS error | Info |
| Pre-existing | - | 3 notifications test fixture failures | Info |
| Pre-existing | - | Flaky lifecycle.test.ts | Info |

**Total tech debt items:** 3 new (all low severity) + 4 pre-existing (info level)

## Conclusion

Milestone v2.3 is ready for completion. All 39 requirements are functionally satisfied. The 3 new tech debt items are minor and non-blocking:
1. Phase 182 VERIFICATION.md can be generated retroactively if desired
2. display.currency highlight is a 1-field cosmetic issue
3. Duplicate search ID is a low-probability rendering risk
